## 🔷 Project


📌 **Introduction**
- Customer churn is a critical issue for businesses, and it is essential to support decision-making processes that minimize churn and promote customer retention.
- A predictive model is developed using supervised learning algorithms to identify potential customers who are likely to cancel their subscriptions to a hypothetical telecommunications service.
<br/>


🍇 **Dataset**
- Churn Customer can be defined as a user who is likely to discontinue using the services. So, the target variable confirm if the customer has churned (1=yes; 0 = no).
- The data included 5.000 users and by the exploratory analysis, it is observed that:
    - 14% of the base are classified as churn.
    - 50% of the customers who called the company more than 3 times are classified as Churn.
    - 10% of those with no international plan are classified as Churn x 8% of those with an international plan are Churn.
